# datapackage-subset
This is a subset of my data package, including data from language and working memory assessment. 

This dataset contains the working memory and language data of my PhD project. Data was collected between January and July 2020 from private and public nursery schools and primary schools. Participants were aged between 5;6 and 6;6 at the time of the collection. Access to schools was given by the Institute of Educational Policy (Ministry of Education) and parental consent was obtained.
