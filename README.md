# datapackage-subset
This is a subset of my data package, including data from baseline (receptive vocabulary, non-verbal IQ, sentence repetition), language, working memory, auditory go/no go task, visual selective attention, and music skills assessment. Overall, this subset corresponds to the correlational aspect of my PhD study.

This dataset contains the baseline (receptive vocabulary, non-verbal IQ, sentence repetition), language, cognitive, and music skills data of my PhD project. Data was collected between January and July 2020 from private and public nursery schools and primary schools in Attica, Greece. Participants were aged between 5;6 and 6;6 at the time of the collection (ages availabe in months). Access to schools was given by the Institute of Educational Policy (Ministry of Education) and parental consent was obtained.
